king
ranchthere
are
two
fields
of
gas
that
i
am
having
difficulty
with
in
the
unifysystem
cage
ranch
since
there
is
no
processing
agreement
that
accomodates
thisgas
on
king
ranch
it
is
my
understanding
hpl
is
selling
the
liquids
andking
ranch
is
re
delivering
to
stratton
it
is
also
my
understanding
thatthere
is
a
cent
feeto
deliver
this
gas
we
need
a
method
to
accomodate
the
volume
flow
on
hplat
meter
and
this
gaswill
not
be
reflected
on
trans
usage
ticket
and
since
it
isnot
being
nominated
from
a
processing
agreement
we
either
need
to
inputa
point
nom
on
hpl
or
krgp
at
these
meters
to
match
the
nom
at
meter
or
a
deal
for
purchase
and
sale
if
king
ranch
is
taking
title
to
the
gas
needs
to
be
input
into
sitara
at
these
meters
with
the
appropriate
rate
ihave
currently
input
a
point
nom
on
krgp
to
accomodate
this
flow
so
we
candivert
some
of
this
gas
to
the
current
interstate
sales
that
are
being
made
forest
oil
there
is
a
processing
agreement
that
will
accomodate
flowfrom
the
meter
into
king
ranch
it
is
myunderstanding
that
this
agreement
was
originally
setup
until
texaco
hadtheir
own
processing
agreement
i
need
confirmation
that
the
gas
from
thismeter
should
be
nominated
on
contract
and
that
this
agreementshould
have
been
reassigned
to
hplc
it
is
currently
still
under
hplr
if
this
gas
is
not
nominated
on
the
above
transport
agreement
then
onceagain
we
need
to
accomodate
the
flow
volume
on
the
hpl

i
have
a
couple
of
issuesi
want
ot
clear
up
for
this
year
s
contract
the
question
is
how
valero
wants
to
treat
the
three
meter
locations
where
youare
currently
pulling
gas
our
new
contract
that
was
just
sent

1233texas

if
you
undertake
at
any
meterexcess
volumes
from
another
meter
would
be
used
to
fulfill
the
entire
000mmbtu
my
accountant
has
told
me
that
this
is
causing
difficulties
with
thetwo
plants
and
how
they
want
to
see
gas
purchases
broken
out
we
discussedthis
on
the
phone
and
i
got
your
consent
to
split
these
invoices
now
we
arebeing
told
all
three

need

you
contact

toreverify
this

i

my
personal

provide
all

necessary
in

i
also
know

marketing
services
schedulingdaren
thinking
about
robert
s
little
memo
yesterday
and
along
the
lines
of
pullingthe
marketing
sitara
function
back
to
your
side
of
the
fence
i
think
astrong
case
could
be
made
in
favor
of
that
idea
it
is
obvious
that
several
people
are
involved
in
changing
tickets
pathing
nominating
and
confirming
the
industrials
this
dissipates
the
knowledgebase
and
the
responsibility
factor
it
is
a
who
s
on
first
issue
if
the
responsibility
to
ensure
pricing
volume
and
accomplishment
of
marketintent
is
accurately
depicted
and
in
sitara
is
in
your
shop
then
theschedulers
could
concentrate
on
the
accuracy
and
correctness
of
unify
andpops
i
m
sure
this
would
help
volume
management
and
client
servicesimmensely
as
the
skill
level
rises
in
this
area
you
could
then
gradually
feed
more
andmore
of
the
marketing
function
sitara
to
the
scheduling
group
in
the
hopesthey
would
then
have
a
better
understanding
of
the
overhaul
picture
i
believe
the
current
situation
is
too
much
too
fast
for
scheduling
tohandle
all
at
once
it
has
also
created
a
situation
where
robert
seems
tothink
not
only
that
he
has
all
the
segments
mastered
but
that
he
is
the
onlyperson
that
should
be
involved
in
the
industrials
i
will
support
whatever
direction
you
want
to
go
on
this
issue
but
if
youand
pat
leave
things
the
way
they
are
please
explain
to
both
robert

may

politicians

have
one

in

they
should
both
be
changed
regularly
and
for
the
same
reason
an
optimist
thinks
that
this
is
the
best
possible
world
a
pessimist
fears
that
this
is
true
there
is
always
death

however
death

people
will
accept
your

much
more
readily
if
you

that
benjamin
franklin
said

it
s
easier
to
fight

than
to
live

i
don

going

an

anything
free
is

indecision
is
the
key
to

it

eventually
you
find
a

you
like

you
get
the
same
sensation
from
a
rocking
chair
that
you
once
got
from

coaster
one
of
life
s
mysteries
is
how
a
two
pound
box
of
candy
can
make
a
woman
gain
five
pounds
it
s
frustrating
when
you
know
all
the
answers
but
nobody
bothers
to
ask
you
the
questions
the
real
art
of
conversation
is
not
only
to
say
the
right
thing
at
the
right
time
but
also
to
leave
unsaid
the
wrong
thing
at
the
tempting
moment
time
may
be
a
great
healer
but
it
s
also
a
lousy
beautician

come
